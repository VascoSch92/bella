v0.0.98
 - FIX incorrect computation of Farey polynomials
 - Increase mpmath precision
 - Add some unit tests
 - Change Farey polynomials to work with initial traces instead of matrix entries
 - Allow computation of Farey words and polynomials after substituting for the generators
 - New syntax for generating Riley slice approximations (slice.py) which allows for
   experiments involving different Farey word substitutions.

v0.0.97
 - Computation of Riley slice approximations (moduli.py).
 - Convert all internals to use [mpmath](https://mpmath.org/) instead of numpy.
 - Add methods (farey.riley_string(), farey.riley_polynomial_*()) to compute Riley words and polynomials.
 - `examples/plotslice.py` now is interactive and shows both Riley and Farey polynomial approximations.
 - Add method (cayley.GroupCache.coloured_isometric_circles_mc()) to produce isometric circles.
 - Rename some methods in farey to make them less ambiguous.
 - Remove functions in farey that compute Phi^inf,inf - 2 because there is no point in having them.

v0.0.96
 - Construction of Riley groups now takes a holonomy angle not an order (use riley.ClassicalRileyGroup for old behaviour).
 - Add new feature to `guess' which pleating ray a particular Riley group lies on (riley.RileyGroup.guess_rational_coordinate()).

v0.0.95
 - Minimum viable product without Riley slice computations.
