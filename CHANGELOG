v0.0.96
 - Construction of Riley groups now takes a holonomy angle not an order (use riley.ClassicalRileyGroup for old behaviour).
 - Add new feature to `guess' which pleating ray a particular Riley group lies on (riley.RileyGroup.guess_rational_coordinate()).

v0.0.95
 - Minimum viable product without Riley slice computations.
