Bella
=====

Bella (short for BeLimDra, 'Better Limit set Drawer') will be an improvement over my
older [Riley computational package](https://github.com/aelzenaar/riley). New features will include:

 - faster group enumeration algorithms
 - more fancy limit set algorithms including the specialised limit set tracing algorithms found in _Indra's Pearls_
 - closer integration with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
 - better visualisation tools using [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org/)

Example
-------
The `limits.py` file contains an example of a HoloViews/Bokeh server to dynamically show limit sets. Run

    panel serve limits.py

with the python packages `holoview`, `bokeh`, `panel`, `pandas` installed to try it.
